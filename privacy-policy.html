    Please see <b>Your State Privacy Rights</b> for more information.</p>

  <h2><strong>Your State Privacy Rights</strong></h2>

    our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request,

  <p>We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from
    unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. All information you provide to us is stored on our secure
    servers behind firewalls.</p>

  <p>The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen)
    a password for access to certain parts of our App and Services, you are responsible for keeping this password
    confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out
    information in public areas like message boards. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user
    of the App or Services. If you receive notice that your personal information (including passwords) have been
    disclosed in a data breach, you should change your password immediately.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet and mobile platforms is not completely secure.
    Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal
    information transmitted through our App or Services. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk.
    We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures we provide.</p>

  <p>We may update our privacy policy from time to time. If we make material changes to how we treat our users&#39;
    personal information, we will notify you by email to the email address specified in your account after we make the
    change.</p>
